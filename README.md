# CrazyError for Windows 10

A recreation of the Crazy error from the online operating system Windows 93 by Jankenpopp and Zombectro

To start it, Run the "RunMe.vbs"

This project was set up with just hopes and dreams

Timers are prone to desync, making the song and the error boxes desync as well, this can happen specially if your power settings mess up with limiting the CPU or overclocking the CPU clock

A PC with at least 2.5GHz and 4 cores is recomended, Windows doesn't like window spam a lot
This probably can be done in a better way and in a real programming language to have it synced with real and propper ways
